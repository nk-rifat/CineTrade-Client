### 🔑 User Ecosystem

1. **Consumer (User):** Accesses the storefront, manages a personal library of purchased content, and tracks total spending.

2. **Content Partner:** A verified creator role. Partners can publish movies, monitor performance analytics, and manage earnings through a dedicated dashboard.

3. **Administrator:** The platform management role responsible for user moderation, partner approval, movie review, and overall financial oversight.

## ⭐ Key Highlights

- Role-based marketplace system (User, Partner, Admin)
- Automated revenue sharing (80/20 model)
- Secure JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Advanced dashboard analytics for all roles
- Scalable MERN architecture with modular design

## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions

- Resolved infinite JWT refresh loop caused by repeated Axios interceptor triggers during route transitions. Implemented a controlled refresh mechanism to prevent multiple concurrent token refresh requests and race conditions, improving authentication stability.

- Fixed an issue where related movies were not loading for guest users by applying conditional query control using `enabled: !!user?.email`, ensuring proper handling of authentication-dependent data fetching and improving consistency across user states.
